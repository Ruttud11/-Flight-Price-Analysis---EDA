# -Flight-Price-Analysis---EDA
Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on  300K+ flight records using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,  Seaborn). 
This project performs an in-depth analysis of flight data to understand the factors that influence ticket prices. It leverages Python and key data analysis libraries to clean and explore the dataset, uncovering important relationships between price and various flight attributes. The goal is to provide a clear and concise understanding of the factors that impact flight costs, including average prices by airline, the relationship between price and flight duration, and the effect of the number of stops on the final ticket price.

**Key Analyses & Insights:**
**Average Price by Airline:** The analysis determined the average ticket price for each airline, providing a clear comparison of pricing strategies across airlines. This insight is valuable for travellers looking for the most economical options.

**Price and Flight Duration:** A key focus was to explore the correlation between flight price and duration. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation, indicating that longer flights generally have higher ticket prices.

**Impact of Stops on Price:** The project investigated how the number of stops (zero, one, or more) affects the final ticket price. The analysis showed a direct relationship, with non-stop flights being the most expensive and flights with one or more stops being more affordable.

**Correlation with Price:** A correlation matrix and heatmap were used to visualise the relationships between ticket price and all other numerical features, confirming which factors have the strongest influence on cost.
